  <p align="left">I'm a software engineer at <strong><a href="https://www.altow.de/">Altow</a></strong> based in ⚓️
    Rostock, Germany. Since I spend most of my time working on projects for clients, most of my code contributions are
    unfortunately not open source - however, a few of my hobby projects can be found here.<br><br>

    I am motivated by my passion for problem-solving and building software solutions. I am always looking for ways to learn and grow and I constantly try to improve my skills to design and implement efficient and effective software
